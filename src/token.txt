We can summarise above picture into following points:

A client sends username/password combination to the server

The server validates the authentication

If authentication is successful, the server creates a JWT token else establishes an error response

On successful authentication, the client gets JWT token in the response body

Client stores that token in local storage or session storage.

From next time, the client for making any request supplies the JWT token in request headers like this. Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

Server upon receiving the JWT validates it and sends the successful response else error.
